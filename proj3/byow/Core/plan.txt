PART 1: World Generator

Create a room or hallway
Choose a random coordinate within that room or hallway
Add border positions to static array that contains all border positions
    This will help add on walls later on

Make a room or hallway starting from that coordinate
Do not put rooms next to each other (hallways can be next to each other)

After generating all of this roomspace, we need to make walls.
To add walls, go through each position:
    if it's a room tile, look at every position around it.
        for every position around it, if it's not room, make it wall.



Second possible generation algorithm:
Make room objects, each with a list that specifies its coordinates
Make some number of rooms (let's say 6)
Then, connect all of the rooms with a connect algorithm.
This algo takes in two rooms, and generates hallways that connects them.
