Very superstitious,
Nothin' more to say,
Very superstitious,
The devil's on his way,
Thirteen month old baby,
Broke the lookin' glass,
Seven years of bad luck,
Good things in your past
When you believe in things
That you don't understand,
Then you suffer,
Superstition ain't the way

From Stevie Wonder's "Superstition"
