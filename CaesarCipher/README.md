# CaesarCipher

CaesarCipher is a simple CLI-interface program that encrypts text using the caesar cipher, and can decrypt encrypted text using letter frequency and chi-squared analysis.
 
## Setup

Download cipher.py. That's it!

## Usage

CaesarCipher can be ran in this form:
```bash
cd *some directory with auto_changer.py*
python3 cipher.py [0 or 1] [infile name] [outfile name]
```
The user should type 0 for encryption, and 1 for decryption. An infile is always needed, but in the case the outfile is not given, cipher.py will automatically create one called nonamegiven.txt in the CWD.
